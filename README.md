# Interview Feedback Helper

A lightweight tool to run quick mock interview sessions. It provides a small question bank, a simple evaluation rubric, and a session summary that can be copied for sharing.
The question bank in `docs/script.js` uses an object keyed by category so each session can filter questions easily.

## Usage

Install dependencies with `npm install` and open `docs/index.html` in a browser. React is loaded from a CDN so no build step is required. You can also run `npm start` to serve the `docs` folder locally and `npm run deploy` to publish it to GitHub Pages.

1. Select a category and number of questions.
2. The rubric adapts to the question type (e.g., STAR for behavioral questions).
3. Score each response from 1â€“5 and add notes if desired.
4. View the session summary and copy it to share feedback.

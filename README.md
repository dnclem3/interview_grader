# Interview Feedback Helper

A lightweight tool to run quick mock interview sessions. It provides a small question bank, a simple evaluation rubric, and a session summary that can be copied for sharing.

## Usage

Open `docs/index.html` in a browser. React is loaded from a CDN so no build step is required.

1. Select a category and number of questions.
2. The rubric adapts to the question type (e.g., STAR for behavioral questions).
3. Score each response from 1â€“5 and add notes if desired.
